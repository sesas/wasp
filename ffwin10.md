# WASP under Windows

Under Windows 10 Pro, the Docker container works fine.
_Students and acedemic staff may be able to purchase a cheap license (free for students) to Windows 10 for Education, that includes the same native support for Docker containers._

Installing the certificate `warcprox-ca.pem` does not work correctly in Firefox when you simply open the file.
You need to explicitly add the certificate in the _Authorities_ tab of the certificates panel (so __not__ in the _Your Certificates_ tab).

After doing that, you are __ready to WASP__ under Windows 10.
